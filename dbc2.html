            One thing that I found especially confusing about CSS is the difference between classes and ID. At first, I felt that I should use classes wherever even if the element I was modifying was a unique case. Although that approach will work, it is considered extreme bad practice. Classes should be used when there are multiple elements to modify and IDs should be only used for unique cases. The same ID cannot be used twice in a single HTML page. Each element can have only one ID, but a class can be used on many elements. Can an element have both an ID and class? Yes! It can have an ID and multiple classes all at the same time if it wanted to. Just remember that ID's are unique.
