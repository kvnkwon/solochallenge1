      Reddit's homepage aims to make its posts visible for any user to view and comment. Page needs to have a search bar and navbar for easy access to other parts of the site. Users should also be able to make a new link or post from the homepage without having to go through extra steps. Visual challenge could be that the site looks a little rough and unkempt with such minimal design. Might look messy with having the posts be displayed in a list from the front page.
